### Build and Run
Execute Spring Boot's run command at the project's root directory:
``` Bash
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```
The embedded Tomcat server will listen on port 8081.
### Solution breakdown
Simple REST api built with Spring Web and Spring Boot. One controller class with one endpoint, a service layer to process the request, and a global exception handler.  
By default, Spring Boot web applications are multi-threaded and will handle multiple requests concurrently.
#### Response times
The Api calls are blocking but due to the fact that they need to be chained in sequence, they can't be called asynchronously.  
We could start a thread for setting the album info and cover art as those operations don't need to wait for the other API calls, but I don't think it'd be worth it since the gains would be marginal.  
In the current state, response times are unacceptable due to an issue covered below in the 'Known Issues' section.  
If the issue is manually bypassed, the average latency after a load test of 1000 calls is around 550ms (almost all due to the Wikidata API that is the slowest by far).  
If there is an exception thrown by the external APIs, the error response is 25ms in average.
#### Testing impl.
To run the Spring Boot tests, execute Maven's verify command at the project's root directory:
``` Bash
$ mvn clean verify
```
(All tests are currently running green.)
* Unit tests for the string search methods that extract the necessary data to build the consequent urls.
* System test using WebTestClient and a real Web Environment. Currently, it allows the aforementioned extreme latency (i.e., it doesn't fail due to timeout). Must be updated once the issue is resolved.
* External load testing with Postman.
#### Known Issues
* Extremely slow GET responses due to following the redirects of the Cover Art Archive API. Repeated calls add a 10+ second penalty. Tried using RestTemplate and got the same result.
### Libraries used
* Spring Web Reactive (WebClient to make the Http calls)
* Jackson for de/serializing
* JUnit 5 and Mockito for unit testing
### MBIDs for manually testing the GET details endpoint
GET_URL = http://localhost:8081/musify/music-artist/details/{mbid}
* ba550d0e-adac-4864-b88b-407cab5e76af
* 2fa95b32-3c11-42d7-b495-12fc6be0a024
* 8e66ea2b-b57b-47d9-8df0-df4630aeb8e5
### TODOs
* more granular exception handling with descriptive error messages
* better response for the case in which one external API fails but we have some artist's data to return
* better test coverage
